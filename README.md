MobileMapStarter
================

A starting framework for mobile maps using Cordova/Phonegap.
A minimal but functional, standalone mobile app from which to build your own creations.

This app is designed for Phonegap/Cordova, therefore it is HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
This consists of ONLY the HTML/CSS/JS components, and not the working Cordova libraries and binaries, the Xcode project files, and so on.

Components of this app:

* HTML/CSS/JS layout -- The app is ready to compile and run via Phonegap.

* config.xml -- The app is ready to upload to Phonegap Build. The included config.xml specifies permissions, icons and splash screens, and more in an easy-to-edit template.

* jQuery Mobile -- A mobile-style user interface theme. Includes jQuery which makes JavaScript useful.

* Leaflet -- Quick, pretty, easy tiled maps.

* File API and L.TileLayer caching system -- Cache Leaflet tiles to device storage for offline use.


COMPILING IT - PHONEGAP BUILD
================

This ready-to-run app is designed for use with Phonegap/Cordova, particularly Phonegap Build.

Simply upload to Phonegap Build and you'll get back a working phone app.

Tip: I myself don't use Phonegap Build due to some issues. Most notably, Android apps are not set to singleTask mode, meaning that when the user taps the icon and the app is already running, a new instance is started without the prior state, selections, etc. Additionally, you can't set more advanced settings such as hiding the taskbar in iOS, using plugins beyond the few supported by Build, and so on.


COMPILING IT - Xcode and Eclipse
================

This code can also form the starting content of the _www_ folder in your Cordova/Phonegap application, and then compiled with Eclipse and XCode.

First, look in _config.xml_ for the "only for PhoneGap Build" paragraphs. You'll want to remove these as they're for the Build service and are not used in local builds.

Second, follow the usual steps for creating a Cordova project:

> cordova create MyApp org.myself.myapp "My Application"

> cd MyApp

> cordova platform add android

> cordova platform add ios

Add some required plugins:

> cordova plugins add org.apache.cordova.file

> cordova plugins add org.apache.cordova.file-transfer

> cordova plugins add org.apache.cordova.geolocation

> cordova plugins add org.apache.cordova.network-information

> cordova plugins add org.apache.cordova.device

Replace the content of _www_ with the MobileMapStarter HTML/JS/CSS payload.

And a small edit to index.html

Look for this tag:

> <script src="phonegap.js"></script>

And rename it to Cordova *if* you're using Cordova instead of Phonegap:

> <script src="cordova.js"></script>

You should be ready to emulate and build:

> cordova prepare android

> cordova run android

> cordova build android --release

> cordova prepare ios

> (then use Run in Xcode)

> (use Archive in Xcode)


PROTOTYPING IN CHROME
================

The HTML/JS will work in Google Chrome, if you enable file access:

> chrome.exe --allow-file-access

I don't recommend developing using file:// URLs, as the File API is still buggy even if you give the --allow-file-access-from-files flag. Instead, install a webserver on your machine and use http://localhost/ URLs.


WALKTHROUGH: EXPLAINING THE CODE & CUSTOMIZING YOUR APP
================

Start with index.js This includes basic settings such as default lat/lng/zoom and your Bing API key.

Check out config.xml to start personalizing your app: the name, author attribution, permissions, and so on.

Swap out splash screens and icons. See splash.png and icon.png, then the splash/ and icons/ folders.

Now start customizing HTML (index.html), CSS (index.css), and JavaScript code (index.js), and start swapping out icons and other graphics under the img/ folder.

Additional, possibly useful, utility functions are found in library.js


BUGS / TODO / WISHES
================

* Nothing, the app is perfect in every way.  ;)
